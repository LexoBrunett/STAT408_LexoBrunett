## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ThirdQuestion}

x_bar_first <- 58.3
n_first <- 25
sigma_first <- 3
confidence_first <-95
alpha_first <- 1 - confidence_first/100

z_firt <- alpha_first/2
error_first <- z_firt*(sigma_first/sqrt(n_first))

print(error_first)
# Second confidence Interval, with n = 100 and  𝑥̅ = 58.3

x_bar_second <- 58.3
n_second <- 100
sigma_second <- 3
confidence_second <-95
alpha_second <- 1 - confidence_second/100


z_second <- alpha_first/2
error_second <- z_second*(sigma_second/sqrt(n_second))

print(error_second)

# Third confidence Interval, with n = 25 and  𝑥̅ = 58.3

x_bar_third <- 58.3
n_third <- 25
sigma_third <- 3
confidence_third <-99
alpha_third <- 1 - confidence_third/100

z_third <- alpha_first/2
error_third <- z_third*(sigma_third/sqrt(n_third))

print(error_third)

```

Compute a 95% CI for 𝜇𝜇 when n = 25 and 𝑥𝑥̅= 58.3 is `r x_bar_first` +- `r error_first`.
Compute a 95% CI for 𝜇𝜇 when n = 100 and 𝑥𝑥̅= 58.3 is `r x_bar_second` +- `r error_second`
Compute a 99% CI for 𝜇𝜇 when n = 25 and 𝑥𝑥̅= 58.3 is `r x_bar_third` +- `r error_third`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r FifthQuestion}
NCbirths <- suppressWarnings(read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LexoBrunett/STAT408_LexoBrunett/main/Datasets/births.csv"))

weights <- NCbirths$weight

weights_in_pounds <- weights/16


weights_in_pounds[1:20]


mean(weights_in_pounds)


prop.table(table(NCbirths$Habit))*100




``` 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r SixthQuestion}
flint <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LexoBrunett/STAT408_LexoBrunett/main/Datasets/flint.csv")


locations = length(flint$Region)

loc_PB_Great = 0
for (x in flint$Pb) {
  if (!is.na(x) & (x >= 15)){
    loc_PB_Great  <- loc_PB_Great + 1
  }
}

percentage = 100*(loc_PB_Great/locations)
print(percentage)

copper_regions <- flint[flint$Region == "North", ]

mean(copper_regions$Cu)

dangerous_Pb_Region <- flint[flint$Pb >= 15, ]

mean(dangerous_Pb_Region$Cu)


mean(flint$Pb)
mean(flint$Cu)

boxplot(x = flint$Pb, main="Lead Levels in Flint, Michigan", xlab="Lead Levels (PPB)") 
boxplot(flint$Pb~flint$Region, main="Lead Levels (PPB) across Regions of Flint, Michigan")

``` 




```{r SeventhQuestion}
hist(weights)

sample_weight <- sample(weights, 10)

mean(sample_weight)
list_means <- c()
for (x in 1:1000) {
  sample_loop <- sample(weights, 10)
  sample_loop <- mean(sample_loop)
  list_means = c(list_means, sample_loop)
}

hist(list_means)


sample_weight <- sample(weights, 30)

mean(sample_weight)
list_means <- c()
for (x in 1:1000) {
  sample_loop <- sample(weights, 30)
  sample_loop <- mean(sample_loop)
  list_means = c(list_means, sample_loop)
}

hist(list_means)


sample_weight <- sample(weights, 100)

mean(sample_weight)
list_means <- c()
for (x in 1:1000) {
  sample_loop <- sample(weights, 100)
  sample_loop <- mean(sample_loop)
  list_means = c(list_means, sample_loop)
}

hist(list_means)

```
